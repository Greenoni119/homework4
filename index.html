      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are web applications that provide a user experience similar to native mobile applications. PWAs are designed to work seamlessly across multiple devices and platforms, and offer several benefits over traditional web applications. These benefits include the ability to work offline, faster loading times, push notifications, and the ability to be installed on a device's home screen, making them accessible just like a native app.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">PWAs are built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and are designed to be responsive, meaning they can adjust their layout and functionality to fit any screen size. </p>
